# Spinning Sandclock — Dynamic 3D Hourglass Particle Simulation by Deividas Strole

Spinning Sandclock is an immersive **WebGL** hourglass animation built with **Three.js**. Created by Deividas Strole, this project simulates thousands of sand-like particles flowing through a rotating 3D hourglass, creating a mesmerizing and realistic falling sand effect in real-time.

This interactive demo showcases advanced particle systems, physics-inspired movement, and smooth 3D rendering—all running directly in the browser.

Developed by Deividas Strole as part of his portfolio, it demonstrates creative Three.js techniques for particle simulations and visual effects.

🚀 Overview

Watch as particles cascade through the narrow neck of a spinning hourglass, piling up realistically at the bottom while the entire structure rotates. The simulation uses Three.js to handle particle positions, velocity, and gravity-like forces, resulting in a hypnotic, fluid motion.

Built by Deividas Strole to explore particle dynamics and 3D animation on the web.
